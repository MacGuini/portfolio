Create a txt file named "dev_notes-local-issues.txt" for notes to address on issues during local development. This name is listed in .gitignore

All other known and solved issues should be listed here


KNOWN ISSUES====================================================================

- Edit function needs to be added to dashboard. Also see if you can work in a JS script to prefill in edit forms.

-Need better dashboard styling. 
    - When you open up the collapsible add script, the other elements change in size and make it look weird.

-Sorting by dragging for resume objects is no longer working

-Redirect from edit-resume not working after adding object

SOLVED ISSUES===================================================================

-All but the experiences are secured to only allow saving to the currently logged in user. Logic was solved in experiences but was never carried over to other resume objects.
(Solution: Used Gemini to match the logic with all of the add views and clean up the file as it was getting messy. Tested the add views after. They all work.)

-Delete function for resume objects other than Experiences redirects incorrectly 
(Solution was in the view of the delete functions. The skill would be stored in a variable named resume and redirected to the edit-resume using the objects id instead of the resume id.)

-Multi Function resumes not working. 
    Checking the boxes for multiple resumes doesn't work when creating an object. But it does work with updating it.
(Solution user was not being passed correctly through forms)

-The add functions for the resume builder are situational specific. It only works if being added from a resume instance. Rather than in general. If you place an "Add" button such as "Add Skill" the same way, the function breaks. 
There may be a conditional statement to make this more versatile. Another option would be to create two different views for adding objects. One for adding directly to a resume and another to add from the dashboard.
(Solution. Changed the views that added from the resume to say from resume in naming.)

-When editing a resume object, the calendar doesn't appear when clicking dates.
(Solution: No idea how I fixed it but it works now)

- DRY There is a lot of repetitive logic in this project.
(Created a single form for all of the objects to use)
