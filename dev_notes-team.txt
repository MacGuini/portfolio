-When adding a resume object to either the resume dashboard or edit resume page, it reloads the page as expected. Try and figure out a way to redirect the view to the section you were just in. So if you add to the skills. Have it scroll down to skills after it reloads the page. There was a lesson about this on w3schools.com regarding HTML links that move the viewing screen to a designated section of the page.

-Add a boolean to the resume model if the user wants it to be public or private. So that even if someone were to guess the link to view their resume, it will not show any of the information. 
    -Add a text field to store a randomly generated key to be required to be included in the link in order to see the resume. That way only those with the link can view it. The user then can select to make it public but must be verified via the key in the URL. The user can choose to randomly generate a new key or create their own unique key of their own.
